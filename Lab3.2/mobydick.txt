extracts supplied by a sub-sub-librarian

it will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
poor devil of a sub-sub appears to have gone through the long vaticans
and street-stalls of the earth picking up whatever random allusions to
whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever sacred or
profane therefore you must not in every case at least take the
higgledy-piggledy whale statements however authentic in these
extracts for veritable gospel cetology far from it as touching the
ancient authors generally as well as the poets here appearing these
extracts are solely valuable or entertaining as affording a glancing
bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously said thought fancied
and sung of leviathan by many nations and generations including our
own

so fare thee well poor devil of a sub-sub whose commentator i am thou
belongest to that hopeless sallow tribe which no wine of this world
will ever warm and for whom even pale sherry would be too rosy-strong
but with whom one sometimes loves to sit and feel poor-devilish too
and grow convivial upon tears and say to them bluntly with full eyes
and empty glasses and in not altogether unpleasant sadnessgive it up
sub-subs for by how much the more pains ye take to please the world
by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless would that i could
clear out hampton court and the tuileries for ye but gulp down your
tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts for your friends
who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens and
making refugees of long-pampered gabriel michael and raphael against
your coming here ye strike but splintered hearts togetherthere ye
shall strike unsplinterable glasses

astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting

chapter  loomings


call me ishmael some years agonever mind how long preciselyhaving
little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on
shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating
the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth
whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up
the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get
such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically
knocking people's hats offthen i account it high time to get to sea
as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a
philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly
take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew
it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me

there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by
wharves as indian isles by coral reefscommerce surrounds it with
her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme
downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and
cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land
look at the crowds of water-gazers there

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears
hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what
do you seeposted like silent sentinels all around the town stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some
leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier-heads some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the
rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these
are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to
counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are
the green fields gone what do they here

but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and
seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of
themleagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets
and avenuesnorth east south and west yet here they all unite
tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither

once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take
almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic
in it let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet a-going and he will
infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region
should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this
experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for
ever

but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest
quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder
cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a
mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
hill-side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though
this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's
head yet all were vain unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the
magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores
on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among tiger-lilieswhat is the
one charm wantingwaterthere is not a drop of water there were
niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to
see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly
needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why
is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at
some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a
passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the
old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate
deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because
he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain
plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see
in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life and this is the key to it all

now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin
to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs
i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger
for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is
but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get
sea-sickgrow quarrelsomedon't sleep of nightsdo not enjoy
themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger
nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a
commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all
honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself
without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not
and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory
in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship-boardyet somehow
i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously
buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who
will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled
fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids

no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast
plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast-head
true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to
spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort
of thing is unpleasant enough it touches one's sense of honour
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the
van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all
if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand
in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a
schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in
time

what of it if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed
i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel
gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who ain't
a slave tell me that well then however the old sea-captains may
order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical
or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is
passed round and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades and
be content

again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must
pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying
and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being
paidwhat will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account
can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves
to perdition

finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck for as in this world
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is
if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the
commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not
so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the
constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me
in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and
doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand
programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as
a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances
i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this

though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the
fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others
were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and
easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough
i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the
circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced
me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all
the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped
to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not
have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting
itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on
barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a
horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
one lodges in

by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the
great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into
my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them
all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air



chapter  the carpet-bag


i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag tucked it under my arm
and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of
old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in
december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet
for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place
would offer till the following monday

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well
be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a
fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though
in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket
was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the
first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen the red-men first sally out in canoes to
give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that
first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported
cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit

now having a night a day and still another night following before me
in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a
matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a
very dubious-looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold
and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had
sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso
wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire
the price and don't be too particular

with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the
crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further
on from the bright red windows of the sword-fish inn there came such
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from
before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches
thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck
my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless
service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too
expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the
broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
within but go on ishmael said i at last don't you hear get away
from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i
went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for
there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns

such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand
and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at
this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of
the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly
open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the
public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an
ash-box in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost
choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the
crossed harpoons and the sword-fishthis then must needs be the
sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
within pushed on and opened a second interior door

it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel
of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the
preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and
wailing and teeth-gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out
wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap

moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks
and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing
a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneaththe
spouter innpeter coffin

coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought
i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this
peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and
the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little
wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from
the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a
poverty-stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee

it was a queer sort of placea gable-ended old house one side palsied
as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever
it did about poor paul's tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a
mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors with his feet on the hob
quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called
euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the only copy
extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at
it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether
thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both
sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough
thought i as this passage occurred to my mindold black-letter thou
reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is
the house what a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies
though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it's too late
to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone
is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus
there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and
shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears
with rags and put a corn-cob into his mouth and yet that would not
keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his
red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what
a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give
me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals

but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra
than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in
order to keep out this frost

now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a
czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a
temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans

but no more of this blubbering now we are going a-whaling and there is
plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet
and see what sort of a place this spouter may be



chapter  the spouter-inn


entering that gable-ended spouter-inn you found yourself in a wide
low straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of
the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint
of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however
wild might not be altogether unwarranted

but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy
soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted
yet was there a sort of indefinite half-attained unimaginable
sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily
took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you
throughit's the black sea in a midnight galeit's the unnatural
combat of the four primal elementsit's a blasted heathit's a
hyperborean winter sceneit's the breaking-up of the icebound stream
of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous
something in the picture's midst that once found out and all the rest
were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish even the great leviathan himself

in fact the artist's design seemed this a final theory of my own
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom
i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape-horner in a
great hurricane the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to
spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself
upon the three mast-heads

the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of
human hair and one was sickle-shaped with a vast handle sweeping round
like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower you
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage
could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking horrifying
implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons
all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long
lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen
whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a
corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale
years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered
nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a
man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the
hump

crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low-arched waycut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place
is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled
planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's
cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corner-anchored
old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelf-like
table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities
gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks projecting from the
further angle of the room stands a dark-looking denthe bara rude
attempt at a right whale's head be that how it may there stands the
vast arched bone of the whale's jaw so wide a coach might almost drive
beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters
bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another
cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little
withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors
deliriums and death

abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though
true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians
rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to
this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so
on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp down for
a shilling

upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i
sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a
room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied
but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections
to sharing a harpooneer's blanket have ye i s'pose you are goin
a-whalin so you'd better get used to that sort of thing

i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should
ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with
the half of any decent man's blanket

i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper
supper'll be ready directly

i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the
battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
his jack-knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but
he didn't make much headway i thought

at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord
said he couldn't afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each
in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and
hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but
the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes
but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in
a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
manner

my boy said the landlord you'll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty

landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it

oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer
is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he don'the eats
nothing but steaks and he likes em rare

the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here

he'll be here afore long was the answer

i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark
complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into
bed before i did

supper over the company went back to the bar-room when knowing not
what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening
as a looker on

presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord
cried that's the grampus's crew i seed her reported in the offing
this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now
we'll have the latest news from the feegees

a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open
and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy
watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all
bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an
eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat
and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they
made a straight wake for the whale's mouththe barwhen the wrinkled
little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all
round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah
mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a
sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how
long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the
weather side of an ice-island

the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering
about most obstreperously

i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise
as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea-gods
had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a
sleeping-partner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will
here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet
in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a coffer-dam i have
seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt
making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep
shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give
him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner
and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall
mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry
of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away
unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and
being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised
a cry of bulkington bulkington where's bulkington and darted out of
the house in pursuit of him

it was now about nine o'clock and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance
of the seamen

no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother i don't know how it is but
people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange
town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely
multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they
all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and
cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin

the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the
thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of
the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over
besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be
home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at
midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming

landlord i've changed my mind about that harpooneeri shan't sleep
with him i'll try the bench here

just as you please i'm sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress and it's a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and
notches but wait a bit skrimshander i've got a carpenter's plane
there in the barwait i say and i'll make ye snug enough so saying
he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning
like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the
plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was
near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven's sake to quitthe
bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the
shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a
brown study

i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too
short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too
narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall
leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under
the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially
as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night

the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldn't i steal
a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon
second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next
morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry all ready to knock me down

still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed i began to think
that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against
this unknown harpooneer thinks i i'll wait awhile he must be dropping
in before long i'll have a good look at him then and perhaps we may
become jolly good bedfellows after allthere's no telling

but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes
and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer

landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such
late hours it was now hard upon twelve o'clock

the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to
be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he
answered generally he's an early birdairley to bed and airley to
riseyes he's the bird what catches the worm but to-night he went out
a peddling you see and i don't see what on airth keeps him so late
unless may be he can't sell his head

can't sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say
landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday
night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town

that's precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn't
sell it here the market's overstocked

with what shouted i

with heads to be sure ain't there too many heads in the world

i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you'd better
stop spinning that yarn to mei'm not green

may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i
rayther guess you'll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin his head

i'll break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlord's

it's broke a'ready said he

broke said ibroke do you mean

sartain and that's the very reason he can't sell it i guess

landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a
snow-stormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one
another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a
bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i
have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion
landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay
that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i've no idea of sleeping
with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying
to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to
a criminal prosecution

wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that's a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy
this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from
the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads
great curios you know and he's sold all on em but one and that one
he's trying to sell to-night cause to-morrow's sunday and it would not
do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to
churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was
goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the
airth like a string of inions

this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed
that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at
the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead idolators

depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man

he pays reg'lar was the rejoinder but come it's getting dreadful
late you had better be turning flukesit's a nice bed sal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there's plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed it's an almighty big bed that why
afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the
foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and
somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm
arter that sal said it wouldn't do come along here i'll give ye a
glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a
clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it's sundayyou won't see that
harpooneer to-night he's come to anchor somewherecome along then do
come won't ye come

i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was
ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough
with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
to sleep abreast

there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table there make
yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from
eyeing the bed but he had disappeared

folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the
most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced
round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see
no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four
walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of
things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed
up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman's bag
containing the harpooneer's wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf
over the fire-place and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed

but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the
light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to
nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat
as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the
streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try
it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and
thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer
had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass
stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore
myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck

i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this
head-peddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on
the bed-side i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in
the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought
a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now
half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about
the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night it being so very
late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and
then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the
care of heaven

whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery
there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep
for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty
nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy
footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room
from under the door

lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal
head-peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word
till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new
zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without
looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the
floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords
of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all
eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while
employed in unlacing the bag's mouth this accomplished however he
turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was of
a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large
blackish looking squares yes it's just as i thought he's a terrible
bedfellow he's been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is
just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face
so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be
sticking-plasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were
stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this
but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of
a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been
tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his
distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it
thought i after all it's only his outside a man can be honest in any
sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that
part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the
squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of
tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man
into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas
and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the
skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning
this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty
having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled
out a sort of tomahawk and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on placing
these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new
zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag
he now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out
with fresh surprise there was no hair on his headnone to speak of at
leastnothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead his
bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull
had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted
out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner

even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but
it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of
this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension
ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and
confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him
as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not
game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inexplicable in him

meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed
his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered
with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same
dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just
escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt still more his very
legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up
the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south
seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it
a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers he might
take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk

but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that
he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or
dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the
pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with
a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo
baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that
this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but
seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal
like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the
empty fire-place and removing the papered fire-board sets up this
little hunch-backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the
chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i
thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
for his congo idol

i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but
ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places
them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into
a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire
and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be
scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit
then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of
it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such
dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange
antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the
devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some
pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the
most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol
up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock

all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and
seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time
now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which
i had so long been bound

but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one
taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an
instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle
he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light
was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth
sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me

stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him
against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might
be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his
guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaning

who-e debel youhe at last saidyou no speak-e dam-me i kill-e
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
dark

landlord for god's sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch
coffin angels save me

speak-e tell-ee me who-ee be or dam-me i kill-e again growled the
cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire
but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him

don't be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldn't
harm a hair of your head

stop your grinning shouted i and why didn't you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibal

i thought ye know'd itdidn't i tell ye he was a peddlin heads
around townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look
hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee

me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed

you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and
throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil
but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment
for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking
cannibal what's all this fuss i have been making about thought i to
myselfthe man's a human being just as i am he has just as much reason
to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober
cannibal than a drunken christian

landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or
whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will
turn in with him but i don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me
it's dangerous besides i ain't insured

this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely
motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to
sayi won't touch a leg of ye

good night landlord said i you may go

i turned in and never slept better in my life



chapter  the counterpane


upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequeg's arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost
thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of
odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure
no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to
his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i
say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could
hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and
it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that
queequeg was hugging me

my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a
child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me
whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle
the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other
was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the st june
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but
there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the
third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets

i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the
small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the
sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the
streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse
and worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my
stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself
at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie
abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most
conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for
several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i
have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at
last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly
waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the before
sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock
running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was
to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung
over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form
or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my
bed-side for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with
the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking
that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be
broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me
but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for
days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding
attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle
myself with it

now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to
those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg's pagan
arm thrown round me but at length all the past night's events soberly
recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to
the comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his
bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly
as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse
himqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over
my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar and suddenly felt a
slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savage's side as if it were a hatchet-faced baby a
pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the
broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of
goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in
extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed
stiff as a pike-staff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he
did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings
now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at
last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow
and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon
the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that
if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress
afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg
under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the
truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what
you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this
particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness
staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless
a man like queequeg you don't see every day he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding

he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one
by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots
what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next
movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed
when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was
hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever
heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his
boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition
stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his
education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not
been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at
last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his
eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not
being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide
onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented
him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning

seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the
street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on
i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he
complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the
morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to
my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table dipped it into water
and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept
his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner
slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little
on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall
begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks
i queequeg this is using rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp
the long straight edges are always kept

the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of
the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his
harpoon like a marshal's baton



chapter  breakfast


i quickly followed suit and descending into the bar-room accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellow

however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a
good thing the more's the pity so if any one man in his own
proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be
backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for

the bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were
nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and
sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers
and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an
unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns

you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this
young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue and
would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days
landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades
lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the
complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached
withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show
a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the
andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates
zone by zone

grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went
to breakfast

they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease
in manner quite self-possessed in company not always though ledyard
the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all
men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the
mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or
the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart
of africa which was the sum of poor mungo's performancesthis kind of
travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had
anywhere

these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every
man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked
embarrassed yes here were a set of sea-dogs many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire
strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here
they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of
kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen

but as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of
the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot
say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially
justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it
there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent
jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but
that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in
most people's estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly

we will not speak of all queequeg's peculiarities here how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks
done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the
rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk-pipe and was sitting
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i
sallied out for a stroll



chapter  the street


if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford

in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not
unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live
yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water
street and wapping in these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors
but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners
savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it
makes a stranger stare

but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians
and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still
more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town
scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain
and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames
fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
the whale-lance many are as green as the green mountains whence they
came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look
there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and
swallow-tailed coat girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife here
comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak

no town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred onei mean a
downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dog-days will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation and joins the great whale-fishery you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his
sea-outfit he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats straps to his
canvas trowsers ah poor hay-seed how bitterly will burst those straps
in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and
all down the throat of the tempest

but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and
bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer
place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this
day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador
as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they
look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live
in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like
canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with
milk nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in
spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patrician-like
houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came
they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses
and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans
one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that

in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their
daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece
you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say
they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles

in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong
avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and
bountiful horse-chestnuts candelabra-wise proffer the passer-by their
tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art
which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces
of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final
day

and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but
roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that
bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of
the puritanic sands



chapter  the chapel


in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman's chapel and few are
the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who
fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not

returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this
special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving
sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i
found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and
widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks
of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from
the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the
chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and
women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders
masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran
something like the following but i do not pretend to quote

sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was
lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november
st  this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister

sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman
walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats
crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the
off-shore ground in the pacific december st  this marble is
here placed by their surviving shipmates

sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows
of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august
d  this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow

shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket i seated myself
near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near
me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze
of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only
person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only
one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid
inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen
whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings
of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were
assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh

oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among
flowers can sayhere here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation
that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those
black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in
the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to
the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might
those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here

in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included
why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no
tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is
that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix
so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if
he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the
life insurance companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals in what
eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies
antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we
still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
whole city all these things are not without their meanings

but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope

it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a
nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky
light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen
who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but
somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine
chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whalinga
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what
then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death
methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that
thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my
better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not
me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and
stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot



chapter  the pulpit


i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it
was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he
was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry
at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone
certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure
peeping forth even beneath february's snow no one having previously
heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without
the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and
certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down
with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed
however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up
in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit
he quietly approached the pulpit

like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a
regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect
it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the
pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like
those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling
captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted
man-ropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and
stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what
manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for
an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the
ornamental knobs of the man-ropes father mapple cast a look upwards
and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity hand
over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel

the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with
swinging ones were of cloth-covered rope only the rounds were of wood
so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the
pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship
these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not
prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn
round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him
impregnable in his little quebec

i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this
father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity
that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks
of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this
thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be
then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual
withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions
yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful
man of god this pulpit i see is a self-containing strongholda lofty
ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls

but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place
borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back
was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers but high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds there
floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel's
face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship's tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into
the victory's plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel
seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy
helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling
offserenest azure is at hand

nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in
the likeness of a ship's bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed
beak

what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earth's
foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the
world from thence it is the storm of god's quick wrath is first
descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is
the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds
yes the world's a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete
and the pulpit is its prow



chapter  the sermon


father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away
to larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midships

there was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches and a
still slighter shuffling of women's shoes and all was quiet again and
every eye on the preacher

he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpit's bows folded his large
brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered
a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
bottom of the sea

this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy

     the ribs and terrors in the whale
     arched over me a dismal gloom
     while all god's sun-lit waves rolled by
     and lift me deepening down to doom

     i saw the opening maw of hell
     with endless pains and sorrows there
     which none but they that feel can tell
     oh i was plunging to despair

     in black distress i called my god
     when i could scarce believe him mine
     he bowed his ear to my complaints
     no more the whale did me confine

     with speed he flew to my relief
     as on a radiant dolphin borne
     awful yet bright as lightning shone
     the face of my deliverer god

     my song for ever shall record
     that terrible that joyful hour
     i give the glory to my god
     his all the mercy and the power


nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon
the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up
jonah

shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one
of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what
depths of the soul does jonah's deep sealine sound what a pregnant
lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the
fish's belly how billow-like and boisterously grand we feel the floods
surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters
sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this
lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a two-stranded
lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot
of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it
is a story of the sin hard-heartedness suddenly awakened fears the
swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and
joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of
amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of godnever
mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard
command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to
doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to
persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in
this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists

with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at
god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will
carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains
of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship
that's bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded
meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city
than the modern cadiz that's the opinion of learned men and where is
cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa
as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the
atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa
shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the
syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye
not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee world-wide from god
miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with
slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered
self-condemning is his look that had there been policemen in those
days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested
ere he touched a deck how plainly he's a fugitive no baggage not a
hat-box valise or carpet-bagno friends accompany him to the wharf
with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the
tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on
board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment
desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger's evil eye
jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence
in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure
the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious
way one whispers to the otherjack he's robbed a widow or joe
do you mark him he's a bigamist or harry lad i guess he's the
adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing
murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill that's stuck
against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering
five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and
containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah
to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah
prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and
summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a
coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong
suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him
not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends
into the cabin

who's there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making
out his papers for the customswho's there oh how that harmless
question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again
but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon
sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah
though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that
hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the
next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing
him no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger ha jonah that's another stab but he swiftly calls away
the captain from that scent i'll sail with yehe saysthe
passage money how much is thati'll pay now for it is particularly
written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this
history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and
taken with the context this is full of meaning

now jonah's captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime
in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this
world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without
a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers
so jonah's captain prepares to test the length of jonah's purse ere he
judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and it's assented
to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same
time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when
jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the
captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any
way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my
state-room sir says jonah now i'm travel-weary i need sleep
thou lookest like it says the captain there's thy room jonah
enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing
him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and
mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed
to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws
himself into his berth and finds the little state-room ceiling almost
resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in
that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship's water-line jonah
feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale
shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards

screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in jonah's room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all
though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it
but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp
alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no
refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more
and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry
oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it
burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness

like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still
reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the
roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as
one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish
praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid
the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the
man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and there's naught
to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonah's prodigy
of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep

and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening
glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded
smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not
bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to
break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her
when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind
is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over jonah's head in all this raging tumult jonah
sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not
the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the
mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after
him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa
berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the
frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what
meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that
direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck
grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is
sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after
wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring
fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep
gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deep

terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing
attitudes the god-fugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark
him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last
fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven
they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was
upon them the lot is jonah's that discovered then how furiously they
mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest
thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior
of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where
from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions
but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the
unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is
upon him

i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well
mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to
make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more
appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating
god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his
desertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest
was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to
save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder
then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not
unreluctantly lay hold of jonah

and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea
is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth
water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto
the lord out of the fish's belly but observe his prayer and learn a
weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for
direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he
leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that
spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy
temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not
clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to
god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of
him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before
you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model
for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like
jonah

while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who
when describing jonah's sea-storm seemed tossed by a storm himself
his deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell his tossed arms seemed the
warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his
swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple
hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them

there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves
of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed
eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself

but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these
words

shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press
upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me
for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down
from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit and
listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more
awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god
how being an anointed pilot-prophet or speaker of true things and
bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled
from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking
ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we
have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to
living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the
midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand
fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the
watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of
any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon
the ocean's utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting
prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the
shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching
up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and
earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the
lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like
two sea-shells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanjonah
did the almighty's bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the
truth to the face of falsehood that was it

this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of
the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from
gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god
has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than
to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe
to him who in this world courts not dishonour woe to him who would
not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him
who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is
himself a castaway

he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his
face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with
a heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of
every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight
than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the main-truck higher than
the kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward
delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever
stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong
arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has
gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the
truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
from under the robes of senators and judges delighttop-gallant
delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his
god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the
waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness
will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final
breatho fatherchiefly known to me by thy rodmortal or immortal
here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this world's or
mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man
that he should live out the lifetime of his god

he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with
his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed
and he was left alone in the place



chapter  a bosom friend


returning to the spouter-inn from the chapel i found queequeg there
quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time
he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove
hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jack-knife
gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his
heathenish way

but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going
to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth
pageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and
giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he
would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number
one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was
only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his
astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited

with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and
hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot
hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw
the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes
fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing
about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim
he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor
whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn
out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it
otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was
his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous
but it reminded me of general washington's head as seen in the popular
busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two
long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington
cannibalistically developed

whilst i was thus closely scanning him half-pretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared
wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference
of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not
know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm
self-collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed
also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the
other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have
no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck
me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something
almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from
home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only way he could
get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving
the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to
himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he
had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be
true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or
so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself
out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he
must have broken his digester

as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that
mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then
only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain
the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of
strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing
savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits
wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself
mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have
repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me i'll
try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but
hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs
and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little
noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last
night's hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps
a little complimented

we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went
to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing
his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat
exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly
passing between us

if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan's
breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left
us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as
i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against
mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were
married meaning in his country's phrase that we were bosom friends
he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this
sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing
to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would
not apply

after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room
together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his
enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out
some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and
mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them
towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he
silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed
the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed
anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i
deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or
otherwise

i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do
you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and
earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do
the will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto do to
my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat is the
will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that
this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular
presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him
in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped
prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with
queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that
done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences
and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat

how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very
bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie
and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts
honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair



chapter  nightgown


we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like
getting up again though day-break was yet some way down the future

yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the
head-board with our four knees drawn up close together and our two
noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warming-pans we felt
very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors
indeed out of bed-clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the
room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some
small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so
a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if
like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this
reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this
sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the
one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal

we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at
once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether
by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always
keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness
of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element
of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon
opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created
darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
twelve-o'clock-at-night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did
i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt
a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said
that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the
bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to
have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full
of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for
the landlord's policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed
confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed
the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a
blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the new-lit
lamp

whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and
eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly
complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his
words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with
his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as
it may prove in the mere skeleton i give



chapter  biographical


queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and
south it is not down in any map true places never are

when a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green
sapling even then in queequeg's ambitious soul lurked a strong desire
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his
father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the
maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though
sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
untutored youth

a sag harbor ship visited his father's bay and queequeg sought a
passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of
seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his father's influence
could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled
off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when
she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low
tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the
water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its
prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the
ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with
one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up
the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled
a ring-bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces

in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and
queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild
desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told
him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis sea
prince of wales never saw the captain's cabin they put him down among
the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming
ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his
untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a
profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to
make his people still happier than they were and more than that
still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon
convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked
infinitely more so than all his father's heathens arrived at last in
old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on
to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also
poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he it's a wicked world in
all meridians i'll die a pagan

and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians
wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer
ways about him though now some time from home

by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having
a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet
and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had
unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas soon as
he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to
sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a
harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now

i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future
movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon
this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my
intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany
me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch
the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap
with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds
to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt
for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not
fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant
of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as
known to merchant seamen

his story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff queequeg embraced
me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we
rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were
sleeping


chapter  wheelbarrow


next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber
for a block i settled my own and comrade's bill using however my
comrade's money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and queequegespecially as peter coffin's cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
whom i now companied with

we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own
poor carpet-bag and queequeg's canvas sack and hammock away we went
down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the
wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg
so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we
heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg
now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked
him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in
substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of
assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers
and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own
scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg
for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon

shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners
of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the
thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it
fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why
said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would
think didn't the people laugh

upon this he told me another story the people of his island of
rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and
this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very
stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis
commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg's sister a
pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding
guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage this captain
marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over
against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the
king queequeg's father grace being saidfor those people have their
grace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such
times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the
ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i say
being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony
of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself
placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking
himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a
mere island king especially in the king's own housethe captain coolly
proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it i suppose for a
huge finger-glass now said queequeg what you tink nowdidn't our
people laugh

at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner
hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new
bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice-covered trees all
glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on
casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world-wandering
whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others
came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and
forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the
start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a
second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever
and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all
earthly effort

gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little
moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings
how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike earththat
common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and
hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
permit no records

at the same foam-fountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me
his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the
blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways
leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the
two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of
this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that
for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a
lubber-like assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who
by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
behind his back i thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come dropping
his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost
miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air
then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset the fellow landed with
bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff

capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer
capting capting here's the devil

hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking
up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that don't you know you
might have killed that chap

what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me

he say said i that you came near kill-e that man there pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn

kill-e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain ah him bevy small-e fish-e queequeg no kill-e
so small-e fish-e queequeg kill-e big whale

look you roared the captain i'll kill-e you you cannibal if you
try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye

but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to
mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
the weather-sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor
fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all
hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it
seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost
in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of
being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the
boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the
midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and
crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one
end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it
round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar
was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the
wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg
stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of
a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog
throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing
his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand
and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone
down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now
took an instant's glance around him and seeming to see just how matters
were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again
one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form
the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands
voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that
hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took
his last long dive

was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at
all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only
asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that
done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the
bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying
to himselfit's a mutual joint-stock world in all meridians we
cannibals must help these christians



chapter  nantucket


nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a
fine run we safely arrived in nantucket

nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of
the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely
than the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of
sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they
don't grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that
pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses
to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an
oasis three blades in a day's walk a prairie that they wear quicksand
shoes something like laplander snow-shoes that they are so shut up
belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island
of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these
extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the red-men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant
indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne
out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same
direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they
discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe
poor little indian's skeleton

what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take
to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in
the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more
experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last
launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in
at behring's straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt-sea
mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults

and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from
their ant-hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like
so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and
indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add
mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm
all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds
of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer's for the sea is his he
owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of
way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but
floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea
as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of
the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the
bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on
the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and
fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there
lies his business which a noah's flood would not interrupt though it
overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie
cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as
chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so
that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more
strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows
so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails
and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of
walruses and whales



chapter  chowder


it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly
to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no
business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of
the spouter-inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the
try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin
hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at
the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first
man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very
much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg
insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust
be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to
say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little
in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant
to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking

two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast planted in front of an
old doorway the horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
side so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows
perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i
could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of
crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two
of them one for queequeg and one for me it's ominous thinks i a
coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones
staring at me in the whalemen's chapel and here a gallows and a pair
of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints
touching tophet

i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn
under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured
eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirt

get along with ye said she to the man or i'll be combing ye

come on queequeg said i all right there's mrs hussey

and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving
mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing
further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and
seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod

what's that about cods ma'am said i with much politeness

clam or cod she repeated

a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey
says i but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time ain't it mrs hussey

but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing
but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to
the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared

queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clam

however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder
came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends
hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into
little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned
with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty
voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food
before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched
it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking
me of mrs hussey's clam and cod announcement i thought i would try
a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word
cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the
savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good
time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us

we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i
to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head
what's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people but look
queequeg ain't that a live eel in your bowl where's your harpoon

fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved
its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for
breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you
began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes the area
before the house was paved with clam-shells mrs hussey wore a polished
necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books
bound in superior old shark-skin there was a fishy flavor to the milk
too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening
to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats i saw
hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the
sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head looking very slip-shod
i assure ye

supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede
me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his
harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i
every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because
it's dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that
unfort'nt v'y'ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with
only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with
his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take
sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for
she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep
it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod to-morrow for
breakfast men

both says i and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety



chapter  the ship


in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and
no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been
diligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo
had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it
everyway that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo
earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to
do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i
ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it
had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship
myself for the present irrespective of queequeg

i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great
confidence in the excellence of yojo's judgment and surprising forecast
of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good
sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all
cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs

now this plan of queequeg's or rather yojo's touching the selection
of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied
upon queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry
us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced
no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly
prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort
of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little
affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our
little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan
or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that
day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself
to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix
articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo
warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among
the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries
i learnt that there were three ships up for three-years voyagesthe
devil-dam the tit-bit and the pequod devil-dam i do not know the
origin of tit-bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was
the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct
as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devil-dam from her
hopped over to the tit-bit and finally going on board the pequod
looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very
ship for us

you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i
knowsquare-toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter-box
galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old
school rather small if anything with an old-fashioned claw-footed look
about her long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms
of all four oceans her old hull's complexion was darkened like a french
grenadier's who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable
bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of japan
where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood
stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her
ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these
her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
old captain peleg many years her chief-mate before he commanded
another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the
principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term of his
chief-mateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid
it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched
by anything except it be thorkill-hake's carved buckler or bedstead she
was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with
pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of
a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all
round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous
jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for
pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not
through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of
sea-ivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported
there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved
from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who
steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds
back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a
most melancholy all noble things are touched with that

now when i looked about the quarter-deck for some one having authority
in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw
nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or
rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main-mast it seemed only
a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten
feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale
planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced
together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in
a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the
top-knot on some old pottowottamie sachem's head a triangular opening
faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a
complete view forward

and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and
the ship's work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of
command he was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair wriggling all
over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructed

there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of
the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen
and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth cut in the quaker style
only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from
his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to
windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
together such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl

is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of
the tent

supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him
he demanded

i was thinking of shipping

thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in a
stove boat

no sir i never have

dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayeh

nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn i've been several
voyages in the merchant service and i think that

merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that
legi'll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of
the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now
ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships
but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks
a little suspicious don't it ehhast not been a pirate hast
thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of
murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea

i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated
quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather
distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the
vineyard

but what takes thee a-whaling i want to know that before i think of
shipping ye

well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world

want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab

who is captain ahab sir

aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship

i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself

thou art speaking to captain pelegthat's who ye are speaking to
young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted
out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we
are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest
to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of
finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap
eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one
leg

what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale

lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured
chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
boatah ah

i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at
the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i
could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed
i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident

look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d'ye see thou
dost not talk shark a bit sure ye've been to sea before now sure of
that

sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the
merchant

hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant
servicedon't aggravate mei won't have it but let us understand each
other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel
inclined for it

i do sir

very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's
throat and then jump after it answer quick

i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be
got rid of that is which i don't take to be the fact

good again now then thou not only wantest to go a-whaling to find
out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to
see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just
step forward there and take a peep over the weather-bow and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there

for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not
knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but
concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl captain peleg started
me on the errand

going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i
could see

well what's the report said peleg when i came back what did ye
see

not much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon though
and there's a squall coming up i think

well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see any more of it eh can't ye see the world where
you stand

i was a little staggered but go a-whaling i must and i would and the
pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now
repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness
to ship me

and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome
along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin

seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with
captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other
shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd
of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each
owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling
vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks
bringing in good interest

now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a
quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified
by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same
quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters they
are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance

so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture
namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood
naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker
idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure
of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown
peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a
scandinavian sea-king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things
unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain
and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion
of many long night-watches in the remotest waters and beneath
constellations never seen here at the north been led to think
untraditionally and independently receiving all nature's sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental
advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes
one in a whole nation's censusa mighty pageant creature formed for
noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically
regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all
men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure
of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but
as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and
still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another
phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances

like captain peleg captain bildad was a well-to-do retired whaleman
but unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called
serious things and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all
his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island
creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native born
quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his
vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of
common consistency about worthy captain peleg though refusing from
conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself
had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe
to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight-bodied coat spilled tuns
upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his
days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do
not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's
religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this
world pays dividends rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes
of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat
from that becoming boat-header chief-mate and captain and finally a
ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous
career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of
sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his
well-earned income

now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks and in his sea-going days a bitter hard
task-master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a
curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew
upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore
exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was
certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least he never used to swear
though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate
quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a
chief-mate to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you made
you feel completely nervous till you could clutch somethinga hammer
or a marling-spike and go to work like mad at something or other
never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own
person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his
long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard
his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his
broad-brimmed hat

such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i
followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks
was small and there bolt-upright sat old bildad who always sat so
and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broad-brim was
placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was
buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous volume

bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been
studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain
knowledge how far ye got bildad

as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate
bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and
seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg

he says he's our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship

dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me

i dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker

what do ye think of him bildad said peleg

he'll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible

i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg
his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said
nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest
and drawing forth the ship's articles placed pen and ink before him
and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time
to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the
voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no
wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of
the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the
degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's
company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own
lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea
could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that
from all i had heard i should be offered at least the th laythat
is the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever
that might eventually amount to and though the th lay was what they
call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a
lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out
on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would
not have to pay one stiver

it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim
sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay
would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i
been offered the th considering i was of a broad-shouldered make

but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard
something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad
how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the
whole management of the ship's affairs to these two and i did not know
but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod
quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his
own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
jack-knife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was
such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded
us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth where moth

well captain bildad interrupted peleg what d'ye say what lay
shall we give this young man

thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much would itwhere moth and rust do
corrupt but lay

lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one
shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt
it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the
magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventy-seven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make
a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time

why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to
swindle this young man he must have more than that

seven hundred and seventy-seventh again said bildad without lifting
his eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is there
will your heart be also

i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye
hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say

bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said
captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the
duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans
many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
orphans the seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay captain peleg

thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the
cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these
matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape
horn

captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can't tell but as thou art still
an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be
but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the
fiery pit captain peleg

fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye
insult me it's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
he's bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and
start my soul-bolts but i'lli'llyes i'll swallow a live goat with
all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drab-coloured
son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye

as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous
oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him

alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who
i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the
transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as
for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more
left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthe
squall's gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at
sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack-knife here needs
the grindstone that's he thank ye bildad now then my young man
ishmael's thy name didn't ye say well then down ye go here ishmael
for the three hundredth lay

captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship
tooshall i bring him down to-morrow

to be sure said peleg fetch him along and we'll look at him

what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himself

oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever
whaled it any turning to me

killed more whales than i can count captain peleg

well bring him along then

and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i
had done a good morning's work and that the pequod was the identical
ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape

but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain
with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in
many cases a whale-ship will be completely fitted out and receive all
her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving
to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the
shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have
a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble
himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till
all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at
him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back
i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found

and what dost thou want of captain ahab it's all right enough thou
art shipped

yes but i should like to see him

but i don't think thou wilt be able to at present i don't know exactly
what's the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort
of sick and yet he don't look so in fact he ain't sick but no he
isn't well either any how young man he won't always see me so i
don't suppose he will thee he's a queer man captain ahabso some
thinkbut a good one oh thou'lt like him well enough no fear no
fear he's a grand ungodly god-like man captain ahab doesn't speak
much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be
forewarned ahab's above the common ahab's been in colleges as well as
mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed
his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance
aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he ain't
captain bildad no and he ain't captain peleg he's ahab boy and ahab
of old thou knowest was a crowned king

and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did
they not lick his blood

come hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance in
his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board
the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself
twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died
when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at
gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps
other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee it's a
lie i know captain ahab well i've sailed with him as mate years ago
i know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like bildad but
a swearing good mansomething like meonly there's a good deal more of
him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on
the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it
was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost
his leg last voyage by that accursed whale he's been a kind of
moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass
off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man it's
better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so
good-bye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happens to
have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages
weddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that
old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless
harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his
humanities

as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been
incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time
i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don't know what
unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange
awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was
not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did
not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed
like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however
my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the
present dark ahab slipped my mind



chapter  the ramadan


as queequeg's ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all
day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall for i
cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations
never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool or those other
creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism
quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of
a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
possessions yet owned and rented in his name

i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these
things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals
pagans and what not because of their half-crazy conceits on these
subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequeg
thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content
and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let
him be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagans
alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and
sadly need mending

towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but
no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg
said i softly through the key-holeall silent i say queequeg why
don't you speak it's iishmael but all remained still as before i
began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought
he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key-hole but
the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key-hole prospect
was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the
foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i
was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of
queequeg's harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken
from him before our mounting to the chamber that's strange thought i
but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or
never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no
possible mistake

queequegqueequegall still something must have happened
apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted
running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
i metthe chamber-maid la la she cried i thought something must
be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was
locked and not a mouse to be heard and it's been just so silent ever
since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your
baggage in for safe keeping la la ma'ammistress murder mrs
hussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i
following

mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation
of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime

wood-house cried i which way to it run for god's sake and fetch
something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe he's had a stroke
depend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs
again empty-handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
vinegar-cruet and the entire castor of her countenance

what's the matter with you young man

get the axe for god's sake run for the doctor some one while i pry
it open

look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet
so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying
open any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm what's the
matter with you what's the matter with you shipmate

in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the
whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i haven't seen
it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing
of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequeg's
harpoon was missing he's killed himself she cried it's unfort'nate
stiggs done over again there goes another counterpanegod pity his poor
motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister
where's that girlthere betty go to snarles the painter and tell
him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and no
smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once kill
the lord be merciful to his ghost what's that noise there you young
man avast there

and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force
open the door

i don't allow it i won't have my premises spoiled go for the
locksmith there's one about a mile from here but avast putting her
hand in her side-pocket here's a key that'll fit i guess let's
see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequeg's
supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within

have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a
little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing
i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark

with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming
against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good
heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and self-collected right
in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on
top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat
like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life

queequeg said i going up to him queequeg what's the matter with
you

he hain't been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady

but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt
like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost
intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained
especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals

mrs hussey said i he's alive at all events so leave us if you
please and i will see to this strange affair myself

closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon
queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could
dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg
nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in
the slightest way

i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do
they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so
yes it's part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he'll
get up sooner or later no doubt it can't last for ever thank god
and his ramadan only comes once a year and i don't believe it's very
punctual then

i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long
stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage as
they called it that is a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig
confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after
listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock i went
up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must
certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he
was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to
grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be
sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room
holding a piece of wood on his head

for heaven's sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have
some supper you'll starve you'll kill yourself queequeg but not a
word did he reply

despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep
and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to
turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as
it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary
round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into
the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought
of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position
stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of
it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan

but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of
day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he
had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints
but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his
forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over

now as i before hinted i have no objection to any person's religion
be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person because that other person don't believe it also but when
a man's religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment
to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point with him

and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed
now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise
and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various
religions of the present time during which time i labored to show
queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham-squattings in
cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless
for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and
common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an
extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained
me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan
of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the
spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
half-starved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish
such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg
said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested
apple-dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary
dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans

i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it
in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great
feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the
afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening

no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the
inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had
visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when
a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the
yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed
in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with
breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were
sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends just as
though these presents were so many christmas turkeys

after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed
dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his
own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one
third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he
no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than
i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and
compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety

at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not
make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the
pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones



chapter  his mark


as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg
carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft
unless they previously produced their papers

what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the
bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf

i mean he replied he must show his papers

yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from
behind peleg's out of the wigwam he must show that he's converted
son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in
communion with any christian church

why said i he's a member of the first congregational church here
be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churches

first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in
deacon deuteronomy coleman's meeting-house and so saying taking
out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the
wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at
queequeg

how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very
long i rather guess young man

no said peleg and he hasn't been baptized right either or it would
have washed some of that devil's blue off his face

do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of
deacon deuteronomy's meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it
every lord's day

i don't know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said
i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first
congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is

young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with meexplain
thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me

finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same
ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there
and queequeg here and all of us and every mother's son and soul of
us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole
worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join
hands

splice thou mean'st splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young
man you'd better ship for a missionary instead of a fore-mast hand
i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomywhy father mapple
himself couldn't beat it and he's reckoned something come aboard come
aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog therewhat's
that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what
a harpoon he's got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it
about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand
in the head of a whale-boat did you ever strike a fish

without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon
the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his
harpoon cried out in some such way as this

cap'ain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well
spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he
darted the iron right over old bildad's broad brim clean across the
ship's decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight

now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos-ee him whale-e
eye why dad whale dead

quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway
quick i say you bildad and get the ship's papers we must have
hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog
we'll give ye the ninetieth lay and that's more than ever was given a
harpooneer yet out of nantucket

so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship's company to which i myself belonged

when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for
signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there don't know how
to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or
make thy mark

but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the
offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so
that through captain peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative
it stood something like this

quohog his x mark

meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broad-skirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting
one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in
queequeg's hands and then grasping them and the book with both his
looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my
duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the
souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i
sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn
the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind
thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit

something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad's language
heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases

avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer
cried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the shark
out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish
there was young nat swaine once the bravest boat-header out of all
nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to
good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and
sheered away from whales for fear of after-claps in case he got stove
and went to davy jones

peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself
as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what
it is to have the fear of death how then can'st thou prate in this
ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this
same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan
that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did'st thou not
think of death and the judgment then

hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and
thrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye
think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink
death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an
everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us
fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think
about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of
and how to save all handshow to rig jury-mastshow to get into the
nearest port that was what i was thinking of

bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck
where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist now and then
he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which
otherwise might have been wasted



chapter  the prophet


shipmates have ye shipped in that ship

queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from
the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when
the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but
shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent small-pox had in all
directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed
bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up

have ye shipped in her he repeated

you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little
more time for an uninterrupted look at him

aye the pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole
arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object

yes said i we have just signed the articles

anything down there about your souls

about what

oh perhaps you hav'n't got any he said quickly no matter though
i know many chaps that hav'n't got anygood luck to em and they are
all the better off for it a soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon

what are you jabbering about shipmate said i

he's got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort
in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis
upon the word he

queequeg said i let's go this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere he's talking about something and somebody we don't know

stop cried the stranger ye said trueye hav'n't seen old thunder
yet have ye

who's old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness
of his manner

captain ahab

what the captain of our ship the pequod

aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye
hav'n't seen him yet have ye

no we hav'n't he's sick they say but is getting better and will be
all right again before long

all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly
derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then
this left arm of mine will be all right not before

what do you know about him

what did they tell you about him say that

they didn't tell much of anything about him only i've heard that he's
a good whale-hunter and a good captain to his crew

that's true that's trueyes both true enough but you must jump when
he gives an order step and growl growl and gothat's the word with
captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape
horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights
nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in
santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash
he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage
according to the prophecy didn't ye hear a word about them matters and
something more eh no i don't think ye did how could ye who knows
it not all nantucket i guess but hows'ever mayhap ye've heard tell
about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare
say oh yes that every one knows a'mosti mean they know he's only one
leg and that a parmacetti took the other off

my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i
don't know and i don't much care for it seems to me that you must be a
little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of
that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about
the loss of his leg

all about it ehsure you doall

pretty sure

with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar-like
stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a
little turned and saidye've shipped have ye names down on the
papers well well what's signed is signed and what's to be will be
and then again perhaps it won't be after all anyhow it's all fixed
and arranged a'ready and some sailors or other must go with him i
suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye
shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye i'm sorry i stopped
ye

look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell
us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are
mistaken in your game that's all i have to say

and it's said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way
you are just the man for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmates
morning oh when ye get there tell em i've concluded not to make one
of em

ah my dear fellow you can't fool us that wayyou can't fool us it
is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great
secret in him

morning to ye shipmates morning

morning it is said i come along queequeg let's leave this crazy
man but stop tell me your name will you

elijah

elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each
other's fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and
looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us
though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i
said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my
comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging
us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this
circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half-hinting half-revealing
shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and half-apprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain
ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver
calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship
the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage
we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things

i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really
dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg
and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without
seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it
seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug



chapter  all astir


a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod
not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on
board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything
betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close captain
peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
look-out upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing
at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
working till long after night-fall

on the day following queequeg's signing the articles word was given at
all the inns where the ship's company were stopping that their chests
must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon
the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps
resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail
for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod
was fully equipped

every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds sauce-pans knives
and forks shovels and tongs napkins nut-crackers and what not are
indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling
which necessitates a three-years housekeeping upon the wide ocean
far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and
though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means
to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the
whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors
usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling
vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of
the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare
lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain
and duplicate ship

at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the
pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water
fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
ends of things both large and small

chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain
bildad's sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she
could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once
fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar
of pickles for the steward's pantry another time with a bunch of quills
for the chief mate's desk where he kept his log a third time with a
roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back never did
any woman better deserve her name which was charityaunt charity as
everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable
aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand
and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and
consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars

but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on
board as she did the last day with a long oil-ladle in one hand and
a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor
captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him
a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down
went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a
while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men
down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head and then
concluded by roaring back into his wigwam

during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the
craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when
he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would
answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard
every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend
to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been
downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea
but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be
already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his
suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said
nothing and tried to think nothing

at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start



chapter  going aboard


it was nearly six o'clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we
drew nigh the wharf

there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to
queequeg it can't be shadows she's off by sunrise i guess come on

avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind
us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself
between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight
strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah

going aboard

hands off will you said i

lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way

ain't going aboard then

yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know
mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent

no no no i wasn't aware of that said elijah slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable
glances

elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we
are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be
detained

ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast

he's cracked queequeg said i come on

holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few
paces

never mind him said i queequeg come on

but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder saiddid ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while ago

struck by this plain matter-of-fact question i answered saying yes
i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure

very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye

once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and
touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye

find who

morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i
was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindit's all one
all in the family toosharp frost this morning ain't it good-bye to
ye shan't see ye again very soon i guess unless it's before the grand
jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for
the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence

at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound
quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the
hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward
to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a
light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber
slept upon him

those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i
looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf
queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would
have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter
were it not for elijah's otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the
thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish
himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleeper's rear as though
feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly
down there

gracious queequeg don't sit there said i

oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way won't hurt him
face

face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then
but how hard he breathes he's heaving himself get off queequeg you
are heavy it's grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look
he'll twitch you off soon i wonder he don't wake

queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and
lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him
in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his
land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king
chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some
of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay
them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on
an excursion much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible
into walking-sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps
in some damp marshy place

while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk
from me he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head

what's that for queequeg

perry easy kill-e oh perry easy

he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe
which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the
strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began
to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed
troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and
rubbed his eyes

holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers

shipped men answered i when does she sail

aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to-day the captain
came aboard last night

what captainahab

who but him indeed

i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we
heard a noise on deck

holloa starbuck's astir said the rigger he's a lively chief mate
that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so
saying he went on deck and we followed

it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively
engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin



chapter  merry christmas


at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers
and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the
ever-thoughtful charity had come off in a whale-boat with her last
gifta night-cap for stubb the second mate her brother-in-law and a
spare bible for the stewardafter all this the two captains peleg
and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg
said

now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is
all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh
well call all hands then muster em aft hereblast em

no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad
but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding

how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain
peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the
quarter-deck just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea as
well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of
him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then
the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was
not at all his proper business but the pilot's and as he was not
yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahab stayed
below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant
service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table
having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends before they
quit the ship for good with the pilot

but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain
peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding and not bildad

aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at
the main-mast mr starbuck drive'em aft

strike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before this
whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the
pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to
be the next thing to heaving up the anchor

man the capstan blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and
the crew sprang for the handspikes

now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it
known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots
of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
order to save the nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say might now
be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching
anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody
to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of
a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will
nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no
profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in
getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice
copy of watts in each seaman's berth

meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would
sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused
on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the
perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious
bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and
seventy-seventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and
turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first
kick

is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared
spring thou sheep-head spring and break thy backbone why don't ye
spring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the red
whiskers spring there scotch-cap spring thou green pants spring i
say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved
along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while
imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i
captain peleg must have been drinking something to-day

at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it
was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into
night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose
freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from
the bows

lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the
old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost
all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady
notes were heard

sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green
so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between


never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they
were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was
yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads
and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring
untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer

at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed
no longer the stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside

it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at
this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet
very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyagebeyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of
his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good-bye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old bildad
lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and
looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only
bounded by the far-off unseen eastern continents looked towards
the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere
and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin
convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern
for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say
nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can

as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all
his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern
came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow
a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate

but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look
about himcaptain bildadcome old shipmate we must go back the
main-yard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now
careful carefulcome bildad boysay your last luck to ye
starbuckluck to ye mr stubbluck to ye mr flaskgood-bye and
good luck to ye alland this day three years i'll have a hot supper
smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away

god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old
bildad almost incoherently i hope ye'll have fine weather now so
that captain ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all
he needs and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go
be careful in the hunt ye mates don't stave the boats needlessly
ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent
within the year don't forget your prayers either mr starbuck mind
that cooper don't waste the spare staves oh the sail-needles are in
the green locker don't whale it too much a lord's days men but don't
miss a fair chance either that's rejecting heaven's good gifts have an
eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was a little leaky i thought
if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication good-bye
good-bye don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr
starbuck it'll spoil be careful with the buttertwenty cents the
pound it was and mind ye if

come come captain bildad stop palaveringaway and with that
peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat

ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a
screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
atlantic



chapter  the lee shore


some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded
mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn

when on that shivering winter's night the pequod thrust her vindictive
bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her
helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man who in mid-winter just landed from a four years dangerous
voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest
things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this
six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say
that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship that miserably
drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port
is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm
blankets friends all that's kind to our mortalities but in that gale
the port the land is that ship's direst jeopardy she must fly all
hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make
her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail
off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would
blow her homeward seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again
for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her
bitterest foe

know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while
the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
treacherous slavish shore

but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless
indefinite as godso better is it to perish in that howling infinite
than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety
for worm-like then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of
the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart
o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy
ocean-perishingstraight up leaps thy apotheosis



chapter  the advocate


as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i
am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done
to us hunters of whales

in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials s.w.f sperm
whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed
pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous

doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is
true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour and
as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall
soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown
and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship
at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even
granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery
decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies
plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit
of the soldier's profession let me assure ye that many a veteran
who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the
apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail fanning into eddies the air
over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared
with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god

but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an all-abounding
adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round
the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory

but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of
scales see what we whalemen are and have been

why did the dutch in de witt's time have admirals of their whaling
fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit
out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did
britain between the years  and  pay to her whalemen in bounties
upwards of l and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of
america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen
thousand men yearly consuming  of dollars the ships worth
at the time of sailing  and every year importing into our
harbors a well reaped harvest of  how comes all this if
there be not something puissant in whaling

but this is not the half look again

i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life
point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in
one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way
and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so
continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may
well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves
pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to
catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past
the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if
american and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the
whale-ship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted
between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes
of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that
scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were
as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their
succourless empty-handedness they in the heathenish sharked waters
and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin
wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would
not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old
south sea voyages those things were but the life-time commonplaces of
our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates
three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
ship's common log ah the world oh the world

until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial
scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and
the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast
it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the
spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it
might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the
liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and
the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts

that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given
to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunder-born
discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores
as pestiferously barbarous but the whale-ship touched there the
whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover
in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were
several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted
isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage
to the whale-ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the
merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their
first destinations if that double-bolted land japan is ever to become
hospitable it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due
for already she is on the threshold

but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no
aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to
shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet
every time

the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you
will say

the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote
the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed
the first narrative of a whaling-voyage who but no less a prince than
alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from
other the norwegian whale-hunter of those times and who pronounced our
glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke

true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no
good blood in their veins

no good blood in their veins they have something better than royal
blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel
afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers
of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and
harpooneersall kith and kin to noble benjaminthis day darting the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other

good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable

whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory
law the whale is declared a royal fish

oh that's only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way

the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty
triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world's capital
the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were
the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession


see subsequent chapters for something more on this head


grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real
dignity in whaling

no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens
attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your
hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i
know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty
whales i account that man more honourable than that great captain of
antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns

and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered
prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if
hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather
have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or
more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here
i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a
whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard



chapter  postscript


in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might
tell eloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not be
blameworthy

it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern
ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there
may be a castor of state how they use the salt preciselywho knows
certain i am however that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his
coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they
anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint
machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential
dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but
meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably
smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hair-oil
unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him
somewhere as a general rule he can't amount to much in his totality

but the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil is
used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil
nor castor oil nor bear's oil nor train oil nor cod-liver oil what
then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted
state the sweetest of all oils

think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and
queens with coronation stuff



chapter  knights and squires


the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a
quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy
coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard
as twice-baked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would
not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of
general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those
summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his
thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and
cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely
the condensation of the man he was by no means ill-looking quite the
contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped
up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified
egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come
and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like
a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well
in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet
lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted
through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a
telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for
all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities
in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to
overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and
endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his
life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that
sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to
spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents
and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the
welded iron of his soul much more did his far-away domestic memories
of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the
original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those
latent influences which in some honest-hearted men restrain the gush
of dare-devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said
starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean
not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises
from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward

aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful
a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long
see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like
stubb or almost any other whale hunter

starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a
sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all
mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this
business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of
the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted
wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down nor
for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting
him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill
whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that
hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was
his own father's where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn
limbs of his brother

with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain
superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which
could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but
it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such
terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature
that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its
confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it
was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or
whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet
cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and
mighty man

but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete
abasement of poor starbuck's fortitude scarce might i have the heart to
write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose
the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint
stock-companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be
men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble
and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves
so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of
a valor-ruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this
august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but
that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it
shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic
dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the
great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his
omnipresence our divine equality

if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic
graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them
all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch
that workman's arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow
over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear
me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal
mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great
democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the
pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves
of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who
didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a
war-horse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all
thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from
the kingly commons bear me out in it o god



chapter  knights and squires


stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence
according to local usage was called a cape-cod-man a happy-go-lucky
neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
for the year good-humored easy and careless he presided over his
whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his
crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stage-driver is about the
snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very death-lock of
the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly as
a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes
while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had
for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he
thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of
it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his
mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir
themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed
the order and not sooner

what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy-going
unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs
what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his that
thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would
almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he
turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from
the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in
readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth

i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his
peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether
ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of
the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the
cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubb's tobacco
smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent

the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in martha's vineyard a
short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of
honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least
water-rat requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this
ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a
three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
that length of time as a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask
was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they
called him king-post on board of the pequod because in form he could
be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic
whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted
into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those
battering seas

now these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous
men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
pequod's boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which
captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales
these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with
their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers
even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins

and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic
knight of old is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when
the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and
moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy
and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set
down who the pequod's harpooneers were and to what headsman each of
them belonged

first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected
for his squire but queequeg is already known

next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly
promontory of martha's vineyard where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring
island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the
fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay-headers tashtego's
long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding
eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their
glittering expressionall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest
of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal
forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild
beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the
infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe
snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
the earlier puritans and half-believed this wild indian to be a son
of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second
mate's squire

third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coal-black
negro-savage with a lion-like treadan ahasuerus to behold suspended
from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called
them ring-bolts and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been
anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues
and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus
daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chess-man
beside him as for the residue of the pequod's company be it said that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though
pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the
american whale fishery as with the american army and military and
merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction
of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all
these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest
of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of
these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound
nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy
peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers
sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to
receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards
they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but
islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders
in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common
continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his
own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were
an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all
the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the
world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever
come back black little piphe never didoh no he went before poor
alabama boy on the grim pequod's forecastle ye shall ere long see him
beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for
to the great quarter-deck on high he was bid strike in with angels and
beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there



chapter  ahab


for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen
of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the
only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin
with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they
but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was
there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate
into the now sacred retreat of the cabin

every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague
disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the
sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened
at times by the ragged elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived
of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasinessto call it sowhich i felt yet whenever i came to look
about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew
were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous
